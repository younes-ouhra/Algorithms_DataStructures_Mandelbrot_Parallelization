# Algorithms and Data Strukturs - Mandelbrot and Parallelization
## About
This project was built along with the Laboratory Algorithms and Data Structures at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany. Also, it simulates representing Mandelbrot-set with and without the parallelization, and measures the requered time to represent the Mandelbrot-set and the efficiency of the parallelization in this case.

## Conclusion
The result of this project was that representing the Mandelbrot-Set with the parallelization helped to achieve few simulation-time in comparison with the sequential process.
